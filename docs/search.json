    "text": "Hi, I’m Raihan! I’m an international student from Indonesia who loves all things creative and tech-related, especially UI/UX. I enjoy exploring unique designs and figuring out how to make digital experiences more intuitive and fun. When I’m not checking out cool ideas, I’m probably watching football (die-hard Man United fan!), diving into manga, or admiring sleek JDM cars.\nThis blog is part of my Homework 3 assignment for IS 407. I’ll be sharing some interesting and reproducible data science projects that blend creativity with insights from data. Hope you enjoy following along!"

    "title": "The Relationship Between Annual Income and Car Price",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dataset Source: Car Sales Report Dataset\nThe scatter plot below shows the relationship between Annual Income and Car Price based on data from a car sales dataset. This data gives insights into car-buying behavior, showing how income influences purchasing decisions.\nOne of the key insights I noticed was that those with higher income levels are linked to higher car prices. The red line within the graph confirmed this by highlighting the relationship between the two variables. While this is true for most, there are some outliers, with some individuals with low incomes purchasing more expensive cars; they are likely to do this through financing or savings. On the other hand, some high-income buyers choose to buy budget-friendly vehicles, which could reflect their priorities or preferences for the car’s practicalities instead.\nFrom the key insights I gained, this visualization is especially useful for car dealerships and manufacturers. Understanding the relationship between income and car prices could help them target the right audience and offer products to a broader range of customers. Lastly, it would be fun to see how this relationship will grow with the rise of electric and alternative fuel vehicles. With new trends, we could see a shift in how income influences people’s choice of cars, and exploring further on this could reveal even more information on consumer behavior.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# Load the dataset\nsetwd(\"/Users/raihanseno/Documents/UIUC/Fall 2024/IS 407/hw3_Raihana2\")\ncar_sales_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/car_sales.csv\") # Ensure file path is correct\n\n# Check column names\ncolnames(car_sales_data)\n\n [1] \"Car_id\"        \"Date\"          \"Customer.Name\" \"Gender\"       \n [5] \"Annual.Income\" \"Dealer_Name\"   \"Company\"       \"Model\"        \n [9] \"Engine\"        \"Transmission\"  \"Color\"         \"Price....\"    \n[13] \"Dealer_No\"     \"Body.Style\"    \"Phone\"         \"Dealer_Region\"\n\n# Filter out rows with missing or invalid data\ncar_sales_filtered &lt;- car_sales_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Annual.Income) & !is.na(Price....)) \n\n# Convert income and price to thousands\ncar_sales_filtered &lt;- car_sales_filtered %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Annual.Income.Thousands = Annual.Income / 1000,\n    Price.Thousands = Price.... / 1000\n  )\n\n# Scatter plot: Car Price vs. Annual Income in thousands\nggplot(car_sales_filtered, aes(x = Price.Thousands, y = Annual.Income.Thousands)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"blue\") + # Add scatter points\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Car Price and Annual Income\",\n    x = \"Car Price (in thousands $)\",\n    y = \"Annual Income (in thousands $)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

Coming at number one as the category with the total installs is gaming apps, with the category-leading the cart with over 30 billion installs; this shows the immense popularity of mobile gaming on a global scale. In second place are communication apps, such as messaging and social media apps, showing how essential their role is in helping people connect. Productivity apps hold the third position, showing how tools are designed to improve efficiency and organization.\nOther categories, including social, tools, family, and photography apps, follow with moderate popularity but significantly fewer installs compared to the top three. This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior, illustrating the types of apps that drive the most engagement on the Play Store.
