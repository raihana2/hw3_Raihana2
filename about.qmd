Hi, I’m Raihan! I’m an international student from Indonesia who loves all things creative and tech-related, especially UI/UX. I enjoy exploring unique designs and figuring out how to make digital experiences more intuitive and fun. When I’m not checking out cool ideas, I’m probably watching football (die-hard Man United fan!), diving into manga, or admiring sleek JDM cars.

This blog is part of my Homework 3 assignment for IS 407. I’ll be sharing some interesting and reproducible data science projects that blend creativity with insights from data. Hope you enjoy following along!
